## About

This project is a web page to check the status of waste sorting at ITP pantry. There are three bins: the big bin (for west studio trash only),recycle bin for paper and plastic and the covered trash can for food. The status of those three bins can be checked through the URL in my page, but now it is only static image I took. And I will update those image at the end of the day since I already learned how to develop and deploy my project! =<

## Notes & Process

DWD is the class that I am looking forward most in this semester, because last semester I already couldn't wait to find Joey to learn how to build a website. However the process of this first assignment is quite painful for me. I had a hard time opening terminal in my Windows computer and finally decided to buy a new Mac. And after I got my new computer I made a very serious mistake which caused my Github banned! I will never forget to check where terminal is working and check hidden files there. (Note: before doing anything to Terminal always check its location by pwd and by ls to show all the files there; also before do something new using Ctrl + C => stop command in terminal) Then after I figured out the dynamic development and deployment methods, I began to have a hard time with HTML/CSS...But thanks to Joey's amazing help and patience, I overcame all of this and make my webpage!

## Process & Documentation

At first I tried to use the webpage to reproduce the graphics of the poster- west studio trash only- which we saw every day in the pantry. I tried to give each tag its property in CSS and put them all together in html part. And it turned out like [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0uk14dfu5b8z90t/process.png?dl=0).I began to search for how to make the text and image like layers in Photoshop. And I found things called background image and adding different classes into one tag(like div.a div.b) and say different things to them. After I organized these elements I added [css transition](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) learned from our class page to make dynamic effect on it.

## Questions

* The padding top/bottom/left/right is talking about the padding outside the <div> or inside the <div>?
* How to change the URL style including the appearance before clicking and after clicked?
